## Project Manager

This is an app to help track personal projects that I'm working on and organize them into one place. Sort of like Jira or a Trello board.

Things it can do:
Create / edit a User (delete reserved for admin functionality in the future)
Create / edit / delete a project.
Create / edit / delete a task.

Projects and tasks have start and end dates. They also have status trackers.

Ruby 3.0.5

'bundle install' in the main directory to install all of the required gems.

'rails -s' to start the server.

You can find the endpoints in routes.rb.
